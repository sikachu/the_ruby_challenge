The Ruby Challenge
==================

This repository contains the code for [The Ruby Challenge] website, which
handles code sample submissions and presentation at [RubyKaigi 2014].

The concept of this talk is a game show, comparing two code sample. A contestant
or the audience will pick the side that they think yields the best result. Then,
those samples will be run with results provided in real-time.

Talk abstract
------------------------

While Ruby doesnâ€™t have a "There should be one, and preferably only one way to
do it" philosophy like Python, writing the best code using the best algorithm
to solve the problem will save you time and money and is going to be better in
the long run. Come join us in this little game show where everyone guesses
which code snippet is the best way to solve a particular problem. Do you think
you can spot the better code?
